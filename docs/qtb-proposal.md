# Recurse proposal 1: Enhance Queer Theory Bot with Recurrent Neural Networks 

September 18th, 2018

## Background

[Queer Theory Bot](https://twitter.com/QueerTheoryBot) was a fun exercise when
Kalil and I built it a few years ago, but it is not very smart.
Currently, [the code](https://github.com/jeancochrane/queer-theory-bot) uses
generated grammars: pieces of sentences are defined ahead of time, and then
randomly put together by the bot. Because of this, QTB's tweets get old fast.

I'd like to experiment with using recurrent neural networks (RNN) to generate
text for QTB based on a large corpus of reference material.
